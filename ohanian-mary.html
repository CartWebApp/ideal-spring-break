  <h1>Mary's Hopes and Dreams In One Week</h1>
  <br>
  <br>
   <p>During my ideal spring break, I would want to go on vacation. It's a pretty average answer, but I haven't gone out of the US yet. I really want to visit a European country, or somewhere around there. I think somewhere like Greece or Malta would fit my personality best. I enjoy rich culture and want to eventually travel the world. For now, I can rely on my parent's paycheck, so I hope I can travel before that ends.</p>

   <p>Other than going on vacation, I would love to be able to fill a sketchbook in a week. Clovis West only gives us a week of spring break, sadly. Imagine being able to fill an entire 100 paged sketchbook! I would consider that to be such an amazing achievement, at least on my part. It would help me improve fast and enhance my skill in certain areas. Other than improvement, the best thing about it is that it's cheap. Who doesn't like a cheap spring break?</p>

   <p>As for who I would want to spend my spring break with? Easy, you might already know her, my best friend Jay. I could bring her along with my family, since they already get along so well. It would be a fun time for everyone and very memorable. Lastly, I would want to bring my dog with me. He hasn't really gone anywhere except the dog park and I want him to be happy. It would be really hard considering his size, but this is my ideal spring break, so what I say goes.</p>

   <p>P.S. I'd also want to go see BTS, but I'm doing that in May already. (If I can win the Hunger Games and get those tickets)</p>
