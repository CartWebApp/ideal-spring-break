       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During spring break I'm going to a cruise to Catalina Island and Mexico with part of my Mom's side of the family for three to four days. I will most likely be hanging out with my cousins during the cruise, by playing video games, eating free food, enjoying the view, and participating in several activities such as concerts and so forth. I'm estatic to go on this cruise because I've never went out of country or went on a cruise and because my favorite cousins are coming as well.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the trip, I plan and hope to stay at home, play video games, watch anime, play piano, and hope to not have any homework. I want to sleep in everyday the last few days of break and when I wake up, I want to go on my phone for about two hours while laying in bed, then get up wash my face, brush my teeth and so forth. From there, I would go into the fridge/freezer looking for something to eat, and put on some anime or youtube videos to watch while food is being microwaved. Then I would hop onto a video game and play with some friends until it's time for me to shower and go to sleep. I would then repeat the process each day until school starts.
