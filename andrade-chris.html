    <h1>Chris Andrade's Ideal Spring Break</h1>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;My ideal spring break would include mostly video games and sleep (basically a week-long version of what I already do on weekends). I've been meaning to get back into Destiny, so ideally, I would play enough Destiny to get my light level up to 650. I would also try to get around to some of the stuff that I've been neglecting around the house, like organizing the cables behind my TV or completely rewiring my computer.</p>

        <p>This is more or less what the inside of my computer currently looks like</p>

    <p>There are also about a dozen books I've been meaning to get to that a week-long break would give me the opportunity to read. They're mostly lore for the World of Warcraft video game series, which I find incredibly interesting. Books set in a video game universe are nearly the only genre I'm interested in reading, so I burn through them in a matter of 2-3 days, then have to find another. One author in particular, Christie Golden, writes amazing books for the Warcraft series, such as Arthas, Tides of War, and Before the Storm.</p>
