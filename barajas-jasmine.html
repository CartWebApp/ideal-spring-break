    <p>My ideal spring break is just not having to go school. The only thing that I would be doing is watching TV with my mom and going outside with my dogs. Some of the things that I would probably watch on the TV would be something on Hulu or Netflix. One of the shows that I like to watch on Hulu would be The Good Doctor. And on Netflix I would probably watch one of the many shows that I am currently watching.
