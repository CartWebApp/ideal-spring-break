         <p>My ideal spring break is just not having to go school. The only thing that I would be doing is watching TV with my mom and going outside with my dogs. Some of the things that I would probably watch on the TV would be something on Hulu or Netflix. One of the shows that I like to watch on Hulu would be The Good Doctor. And on Netflix I would probably watch one of the many shows that I am currently watching.

         <p>My ideal spring break would consist of not having to do anything, but that’s never going to happen. Another thing that I would do would be going to my friend’s house. We would probably just walk around with our dogs, since she has four and I have four and that would be fun. I would just stay at home eat and sleep and do it all over again, that would really be my ideal spring break.
