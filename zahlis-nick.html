 <h1 class="title">My Ideal Spring Break</h1>
 <p class="main-text-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ideal spring break consists of sleeping late and playing a lot of video games. Unless my family plans a vacation, I would probably spend almost all of my time at my house. I might hang out with my friends once or twice, but most of my time off would be spent alone or talking to others online.</p>

 <h2 class="subtitle">What Games I Would Play</h2> 
 
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would probably spend my time playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive during spring break. It's the game I've been playing the most recently, and my friends enjoy playing it too.</p>
