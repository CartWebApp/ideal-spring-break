    <h1>An Ideal Spring Break</h1>

    <p>My ideal spring break would be a week full of sunny weather, and around that of ~75 degrees. The flowers and trees would be blooming, and it would be fun to go outside again. I would be able to sleep in everyday until noon, and I would not have to travel anywhere over the course of the week. I could wear a jacket if I wanted to, but it wouldn't be necessary to keep myself warm. I would finally be able to wear shorts again, and the morning would have a beautiful glow to them. There would be clouds quite often, but they'd all be clear white and not cover up the amazing baby blue sky.</p>

    <p>This would be the time of year that the snow begins to melt up in the mountains. This means that I could go on hikes with my dad in Yosemite, and the weather and settings are perfect for this type of activity. This is also a fun time to go to Disneyland, as the temperature is just perfect so that it's not blazing hot, but warm enough to go on all the water rides without needing to worry about getting off freezing. The crowds will be just as bad as ever, but with some luck with a forecast of rain, it's possible to have a lesser population in the park.</p>
