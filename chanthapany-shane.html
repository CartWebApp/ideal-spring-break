		<div><p>I have many ideals what a spring break should be in my opinion.</p></div>
		<div ><img src="img/Brothers-BBQ-Barbecue-Catering-Denver-64.jpg" alt="bbq in spring" class="bbq"></div>
		<div>First, off it should have many people gathering for a bbq party and enjoying other people company. The other good thing is that you can enjoy good food from other culters.</div>

		<div><p><u>Second Idea for spring Break</u></p></div>
		<div ><img src="img/gaming.gif" alt="bbq in spring" class="bbq"></div>
		<div>Gaming should be a good idea. Why? Because gaming is very fun to play with friends. Say that your going somewhere far away during this spring break and you can't meet up with your friends. The soultion to that is to play videogames online so you can keep in touch with your friends!</div>
