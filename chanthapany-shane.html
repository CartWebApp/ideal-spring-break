		<div><p><u>First Idea for spring break</u></p></div>
		<div ><img src="img/Brothers-BBQ-Barbecue-Catering-Denver-64.jpg" alt="bbq in spring" class="bbq"></div>
		<div>I have many ideals what a spring break should be in my opinion.  It should have many people gathering for a bbq party and enjoying other people company. The other good thing is that you can enjoy good food from other culters.</div>

		<div><p><u>Second Idea for spring Break</u></p></div>
		<div ><img src="img/gaming.gif" alt="bbq in spring" class="bbq"></div>
		<div>Gaming should be a good idea. Why? Because gaming is very fun to play with friends. Say that your going somewhere far away during this spring break and you can't meet up with your friends. The soultion to that is to play videogames online so you can keep in touch with your friends!</div>

		<div><u>Third and last Idea for spring break</u></div>
		<div><img src="img/anime.gif" alt=""></div>
		<div>My last idea for spring break would be watching anime. Anime is my favourite thing to do if I have nothing to do. I can watch anime for days, I would end up satying up all night watching anime because its to addicting for me.</div>
