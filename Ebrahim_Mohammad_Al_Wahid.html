    <p>Playing games and socializing with friends is my ideal spring break. While at the same time being Able to go to the gym from time to time. I would also like myself to be able to work more so I can earn some extra money during this week of vacation. Lastly I would like it if I could got to the beach on the weekend before spring break ends. One more thing that I forgot to mention is playing league of legends. I would also like to start getting good at Apex legends so lovepreet will stop getting us both killed whenever we play.
