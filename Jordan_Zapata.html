    <h1>The family interaction</h1>
    <p>During my Spring Break, I hope to spend a lot of my time with my family. I will spend Easter with my family that lives in Stockton, CA. <br />Also, we are going to have a lot of fun with a family game called cascorones. <br />The goal of this game is to crack eggs over someone's head and the eggs have confetti in them. <br />All in all, it will be a fun time to hang out with my family during Spring Break.</p>

    <h1>My free time</h1>
    <p>Hopefully, I will have plenty of time to play video games during the break. <br />I hope to catch up on Dead by Daylight, which I haven't played in a while. <br />Also, I want to play some anthem and apex with my friends over the break. <br />I also plan to pull a couple of all-nighters with my best friend</p>

    <h1>Hanging out with my friends</h1>
    <p>Speaking of friends, I also am planning to hang out with a lot of people over the break. <br />I am planning to spend an entire weekend with some of my friends. <br />I plan to pull all-nighters with them, play a bunch of video games, and eat a lot of junk food.</p>
