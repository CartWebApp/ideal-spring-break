       My ideal spring break would be to stay at home and try to animate something since I'm usually too lazy to do something. I also would want to try and accomplish rigging some of the models that I have without a problem. Then I would be able to animate with the models easier. I also want to find more unique shaders to use for the animation program (MMD) I use and see if they would work on my laptop. Some shaders that I am interested in won't work since my laptop can't handle it, which sucks.

       I also want to just lay in bed and play on my phone the whole time and only come out to eat and use the bathroom. That way I can relax more and just look and find for new memes to laugh at because I really don't do anything else. I would play games too but I am far too lazy to do that. That involves a lot of energy and time to do. I have to get up from bed, sit down on a chair, turn on my laptop, and wait for it to turn on. Then once I put my password in I will stare at my screen for a good minute just to think what I want to play but I eventually just decide to not play any games and go back to bed.

        Also, here is a quick story about Spongebob. Spongebob is a wonderful fifty year old sponge in Bikini Bottom. He loves to go out with his best friend Patrick Star, who is 34 and acts like a 3 year old. Focusing more on Spongebob, he has three beautiful long lashes on each eyelid and very extraordinary blue eyes that every species in his community loves to stare at. But here is the sad thing no one knows about Mr. Squarepants. His orignal (real) name was Spongeboy. The End.

       But yes I would also like to watch Spongebob during the break since Spongebob is having their own youtube channel. I hope it's not a youtube premium thing because I don't want to pay one dollar for every episode. I'll be able to watch every episode without a weird small screen and bad audio quality.
