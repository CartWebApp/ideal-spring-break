    <h1 class="header">My Ideal Spring Break</h1>

    <p class="one">I would spend my spring break in Mars with Gekyume and go around listening to moonlight in mars. After spending time with Gekyume I will then go to Russia, and drunk jet skiing with Michelle Obama while listening to Rock You Like A Hurricane by Scorpions. Then I will proceed to back to Mars and save Oppurtunity as well as giving him a friend named WALL-E. WALL-E will be blasting Around the World by Daft Punk with his built in Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth Speaker (Black). While WALL-E is blasting Daft Punk Oppy will be blasting Around the World by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Elon Musk and I will be driving the electric jet that he newly developed with interior corocodile alligator leather. When the night starts to encompass the land we will be blasting some Prince while the acid rain starts to pour down on us. That's where Ben Shapiro swoops in with his all terrain Rolls Royce that is not only a convertible but turns into a B-2 Stealth Bomber. Once we finally head back to earth, I will head to Havana Cuba and recreate a scene from Die Another Day where James Bond manages to get this hot lady by just talking about birds. Once that is done I will go to Universal studios and drain all the water from their rides and ship it to Africa to recreate The Great Bath, but instead of water we will use mustard soda. Then I will invite the worlds leaders to a pro league match of Rainbow Six: Siege, and if whoever's team is victorious gets to rule the world. Once my super duper awesome exhilarating spring break is coming to a close I will fly off into the sunset with Megamind and we will shut the sun down with 50 quintillion super soakers. Fin. To add to that our adventure will be filmed making it into a documentary. Jean Claude Van Damme plays me and Michael Jackson's hologram plays Elon Musk. Then I will replace Lake Tahoe's water with Canada Dry Ginger Ale. To end it all we I will make every 7.53 billion people yell out, "Moonlight uh, spotlight uh, country roads, take me home, it's-a me Mario, West Virgin-yuh yeet; yee-yee!" The End.</p>
