        <p>
            Spring break is a time where one should relax. Therefore I will spend most of my time sleeping. Juggling CART projects with so many other assignments is tiresome. Not dying from seasonal allergies would be nice too, but with the state I am currently in, there is no guarantee that will happen.

            In order to survive this flaw in nature, I will have to stay inside all week, which I probably would have done anyway. This means I have an excuse to do nothing productive for seven days. I however, am the kind of person who has to be doing something productive, or else they feel guilty. When I am not sleeping, I will be writing and revising my story. I wouldn't be able to forgive myself for putting that off while I have so much free time.

            It's nice to imagine what one will do when they have a week to themselves. However, Spring break wonm't come until halfway through April for reasons that are beyond me, so until then, I continue to barely remain concious.
