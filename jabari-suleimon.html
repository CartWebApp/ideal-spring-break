    <h1>The Best Spring Break E V E R !!</h1>
    <p>
        First, I would start my spring break chillin with my homies. I would throw the largest party of the millennium. We would throw a huge party with all of my favorite artists. It would be like Coachella, but even more extravegent. I would have performances by artists who are alive and artists who are dead. Tupac, 21 Savage, A$ap Rocky, Afroman, Amin&eacute;, Ayo &amp; Teo, Big Sean, Blueface, BROCKHAMPTON, Chance the Rapper, Chilidh Gambino, D12, DMX, Drake, E-40, Earl Sweatshirt, Eminem, Flipp Dinero, J. Cole, Joey Bada$$, Joey Trap, Joyner LUcas, Lil Yachty, Mac Dre, Mike Sherm, Muse, Metallica, Fall Out Boy, N.W.A., The Notorious B.I.G., Odd Future, Outkast, Denzel Curry, RBL Posse, Sage The Gemini, ScHoolboy Q, Ski Mask The Slump God, Snoop Dogg, SOB X RBE, T-Pain, Tay-K, YBN Cordae, YBN Nahmir, Tenacious D, Travis Scott, Trippie Redd, Tyga, Ugly God, Vince Staples, Warren G, Yung Gravy, and YG would all perform. There would be free food, drinks, and activities to keep everyone entertained.

        After my three day festival, I would rotate between sleeping, eating and playing League of Legends or Apex Legends. Two days of this would help me recharge. Once I am recharged, I will get a great workout with Goku, Piccolo, Trunks, Meliodas, Ban, Escanor, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Once I get my instant six-pack, I would do some inter-dimensional traveling with Rick and Morty. After visiting different dimensions for a couple days, I would use rick's portal gun and Hermione's time turner to stay on spring break forever. I would stop by the fountain of youth to stay young forever.
