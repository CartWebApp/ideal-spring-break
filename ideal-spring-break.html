    <h1>My Ideal Spring Break</h1>
    <p>The way I would start my spring break would be by sleeping in til maybe about 8 to 9 o'clock evry morning. Then maybe going out with my family for a meal or an adventure to somewhere we haven't been in a while as a family</p>

    <p>I would try to set up a day where my friends and I could hang out with each other and have some freedom that comes with being a teenager. But I think that I would just enjoy some peace and quiet to maybe clear my thoughts and regain my nerves before continuing to reach graduation. </p>
