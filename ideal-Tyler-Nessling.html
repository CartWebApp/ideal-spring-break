   <h1>My Ideal Spring Break</h1>
    <p>
        My ideal spring break is to hang out in my family's cabin in the mountains. The mountains might have snow that I could play with my dogs in who love the snow. There are also a large amout of movies and a tv in the cabin that my family use a lot in the cabin. We also have a boat which we can take on to the lake and go fishing.

The resteraunt behind the pizza place is a traditional resteraunt that is run and owned by local people. finally down the road is a popular burger place that serves well made milkshakes.
