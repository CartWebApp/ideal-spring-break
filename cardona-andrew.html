   <h1><u>My Ideal Spring Break</u></h1>
    <div class="flex-container">
        <p class="p1">I'd like to start my morning by forcing myself to get up at 4:00 am and then go back to sleep just to have the satisfaction of realizing that I don't have to get up early. When I go back to sleep, I'd like to experience several short drems. I'd like the first dream to consist of a Pokemon battle. I would like to command a team that consists of Charizard, Greninja, Rayquaza, Lucario, Togekiss, and Venusaur. The second dream should somehow consist of hookers. The third dream should include Bakugan. Then, I'd wake up at 10:00 am. From there, I'd like to either make myself a delicous, home-cooked meal or just eat something pre-made, depending on how lazy I feel. I will likely make myself some coffee or hot chocolate. Then, I'd start my day.</p>

        <p class="p2">I'd like to not have any homework. After breakfast, I will watch Naruto Shippuden until I get bored. Than, I'll eat more food. I don't what I'll eat, but I just want to eat some good food. While eating a rather large snack, I would surf the recommended section of YouTube. I would spend multiple hours on my phone every day. At some point, I would like to play Warframe. Later in the day, I will leave for jiu-jitsu practice. Hopefully, I will have fun. After getting home, I will take a nice, long, hot shower with Death Battle playing in the background. After the shower, I would either make myself dinner, have leftovers, or wait for my mom to make dinner. During dinner, I would likely watch How I met Your Mother. After dinner, I would continue to be on my phone until I decide to go to sleep.</p>
