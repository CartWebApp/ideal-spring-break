       My perfect spring break whould be spent at the beach. I would go boggie bording and swimming all day. I would build a sand castle and have my family bury me in the sand. I wouldn't get stung by a sting ray this time. Then after a day or two of that I would get in a rocket and go to Mars.

        While I'm on Mars I would vist Olympus Mons mountain. I would bring Martian skiis and ski down it. Then I would vist some of the Mars Rovers. After I had my fun there I would return to Earth.

        I decided that I wanna be the very best, like no one every was. To catch them is my real test, to train them is my cause. I will travel across the land serching far and wide, each pokemon to understand the power thats inside. I would finally complete the pokedex and catch them all.

        After that I will go to Busan and meet Hana Song. I make good friends with her and she lets me fly her mech around. I will help her on her next mission to defeat the Keshin.
